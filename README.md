Computational drug repositioning
=================
MBiRW is one novel computational method, which utilizes comprehensive similarity measures and Bi-Random walk algorithm to identify potential novel indications for a given drug.

Dataset.

1) DrugSimMat and DiseaseSimMat store drug similarity matrix and disease similarity matrix, respectively;

2) DiDrAMat stores known disease-drug association information;

3) DrugsName and DiseasesName store drug ids and disease ids, respectively;

4) For each drug pair, the number of their sharing common diseases is stored in shareWrr.mat;

5) For each disease pair, the number of their sharing common drugs is stored in shareWdd.mat;

6) CDataSets store the combined datasets; Datasets_indep store the independent dataset.
